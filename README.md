The **Swift AI Agent Demo** is a native iOS application that demonstrates the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) AI agent pattern using SwiftUI. 
This app allows users to observe how an AI agent thinks, acts, and solves problems step-by-step.
The application leverages OpenAI's GPT models to showcase real-time interactions and intelligent responses.
